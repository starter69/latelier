# L'atelier Roadmap

## Short term

### Accessibility

L'atelier should be more accessible. It means that everything should be usable by keyboard, and layout/ui should respect the RGAA specifications.

### Open data

All data stored in l'atelier should be accessible and downloadable in open formats (csv, xml, json for instance).

The openness should be bidirectional: a user should be able to upload data.

Examples:

- Import/export BPMN files
- Import/export project tasks to CSV
- Import/export health reports
- Import/export canvas

### Improve performances

Every non critical publications should be replaced with a traditional RPC call.


## Long term

### Add other tools to manage projects

A project is not only a list of tasks.

L'atelier should provide all needed features in one place.

Examples (need refinement):

- realtime chat (by integrating existing software like rocket.chat for example)
- manage project meetings
- whiteboard
- general diagramming tool

### Analysis for everybody

Statistics should be available per project/organization/global.

- Statistics per project/organization/global
- Improve administrator backoffice
- Public view
- Preview files

### Technical stack

- Investigate backend alternative for better performances

Meteor is known for not being able to scale easily. Other backends should be studied.
